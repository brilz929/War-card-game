# War Card Game

A simple implementation of the classic War card game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎮 How to Play

War is a simple card game where each player plays a card, and the player with the higher card wins the round. If the cards are of equal rank, it's war!

### Rules:
1. The deck is divided evenly between two players
2. Each player reveals the top card of their deck
3. The player with the higher card takes both cards and adds them to their pile
4. If the cards are of equal rank, a war occurs:
   - Each player places three cards face down
   - Each player reveals one more card
   - The player with the higher card takes all the cards in play
5. The game continues until one player has all the cards
